I did the assignment by myself.

The customer manager implemented using hash table was much more faster than the one using array.
The customer manager implemented using array must traverse all the array to search a user info.
However, the one implmented using hast table can search a user info with just traversing the part of the data.

I have implemented the hash table expansion in RegisterCustomer function.

It took 10 hours.
